Work Done

The Library folder has the files for the libraries created and used by JUCE. 
the source folder contains the source code used for both the audio input demo and the layout of the rest of the vst.
Problem: When Xcode compiles code it creates a stand alone program but does not acknowledge new code. 

Disregard the files from 2 months ago. idk how to get them out
